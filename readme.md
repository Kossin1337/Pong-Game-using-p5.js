This project was my first time building a simple game
Game is designed for 2 players co-op or rather 1v1
1st player movement keys are: (W - upwards, D - downwards)
2nd player movement keys are: (upArrow and downArrow or 8 and 2 on numerical keyboard)

It was a lot of fun making it
I learned about canvas animations in p5.js
Collisions detection and game design principles

You can take the code and modify it or add another functionality
Have a nice day ^^
